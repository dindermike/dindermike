## AI Templates

&emsp;These are templates generated using [Claude.AI](https://claude.ai) as a generative code tool. This directory contains templates that I may have generated and wanted to save but decided not to use in any way. I tend to generate a lot of different templates just for the sake of generating them for practice.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Title</th>
      <th align="center">Prompt</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Template 1</td>
      <td align="left">Generate a basic landing page in html with the appropriate Javascript to display an IT resume geared towards software engineering with fun features like parallax scrolling and any other features that I haven't thought of that might help the content pop out and engage with the visitor of the page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Template 2</td>
      <td align="left">...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Template 3</td>
      <td align="left">...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
