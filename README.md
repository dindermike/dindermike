&emsp;I am actively looking for Software Engineering roles, such as Software Engineer, Software Developer, Backend Engineer, Backend Developer, Python Developer, Django Developer, etc...

&emsp;Please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikedinder/) or via [E-Mail](mailto:dindermike@hotmail.com) if you have any roles that align with what I am looking for.

&emsp;In the meantime, please view my repository for some of my study and practice code. There are some private repositories of work that I do not intend to share. As well there is also some other private projects that will support my personal website [www.mikedinder.com](www.mikedinder.com). Some repositories will be dedicated for sub-domains of www.mikedinder.com and are works in progress at this time. They will be listed here when they become live.

&emsp;If anyone is wondering why my Pronoun section says "I am a Meat Popsicle", that is a reference to the movie The 5th Element. You can see a [clip here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd_qiuWxPs).
